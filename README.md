# 🚀 ACODER — My First Developer Website 🌐✨

Hey there! This is **ACODER**, my first-ever website project — built entirely using just **HTML and CSS** (no JavaScript!) and a whole lot of creativity. It's a clean, dev-focused platform designed to organize learning resources with a sleek, animated interface.

## 💡 What is ACODER?

> ACODER is a static yet visually rich website built without JavaScript. It uses only HTML & CSS for layout, animations, and interactivity — plus a bonus 3D robot from Spline for that extra WOW factor 💫.

## 🔍 Features

- 🎯 **Tabbed Learning Interface** – Organized sections for Guides, Tutorials, and Case Studies
- 🌙 **Dark Theme UI** – A developer aesthetic that’s easy on the eyes
- 🎥 **Smooth Transitions** – CSS-powered animations for tab changes
- 🧼 **No JavaScript Needed** – Everything is done with HTML5 and CSS3
- 🤖 **3D Robot Integration** – Embedded an interactive 3D robot from [Spline](https://spline.design) for a futuristic touch
